## About the Project

- I wasn't happy with my professional portfolio being a template attached to the static personal site I built before starting my full-stack web development classes. While I've been job hunting, I've been building this site as a side project, and diving into aspects of front-end I love. It's built in React and CSS, incorporating react-transition-group. The landing page has the first svg I coded myself, and I've learned a lot about keyframes! I spent a lot of time on the light/dark mode - building the toggle, flipping it, adjusting its size, and making sure it shows the correct side no matter which theme is loaded. I enjoyed learning about CSS variables to create the dark and light themes, including getting the svgs to switch colors! This was the first project I deployed with Netlify, and setting up a serverless contact form was a breeze!
